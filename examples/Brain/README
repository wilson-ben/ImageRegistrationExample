
This Directory contains image from BRAINWEB project 
in META IMAGE file format.

The BrainWeb project home page is :

   http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb

--------------------------------------------------

The MetaImage file format is composed of a text
file header with extension .mha and a binary file
with raw data. The raw data can also be read with
RAW format readers directly.

The images in this directory were created by 
downloading the binary data from the BrainWeb
page and creating a MetaImage text header for 
them using the information about the images like
number of voxels in each dimension and spacing
along each dimension. The original information 
for each image in on the .txt files.

Following these MetaImage text headers as examples
it should be relatively easy to create headers 
for other binary files of your own.

In order to provide test images for registration
methods some of the data sets have been translated
and rotated. The initial part of the filenames
will match the corresponding original image while
the end of the file name has the suffix: Rot##Tx##

Those files with Rot20Tx20 have been rotated 20 
degrees and translated 20 pixels on X.  Note that 
the center of rotation is the pixel with index 
[0,0,0] not the center of the volume.

 
For example, in the list below: 


    brainweb165a10f17.raw
    brainweb165a10f17Rot10Tx15.raw
    brainweb165a10f17Rot20Tx20.raw


the first file is the origina image as downloaded 
from BrainWeb The second is the result of a 10 
degrees rotation and 15 pixels translation on X. 
The third image is the result of a 20 degrees 
rotation and a translation of 20 pixels on X.
